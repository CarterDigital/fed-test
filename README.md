# Carter FED Test - Matthew Poppell Submission

## Notes
Created using Gulp, HTML, SASS, Handlebars.js & Meyerwebs css reset.

## Noted Browser Incompatibilities

### CSS Grid
I decided to take the opportunity of using CSS-grid as I have not before tried it. This is not compatable with IE unfortunately, but it is definately worth trying out. For something requiring IE compatibility I would likely use either Bootstrap grid or something custom.  

### SVG via background-img & mask
Similarly, my implementation of the SVG files is not yet compatible with Edge, but was an opportunity for me to implement it from a different direction. Previously I have included SVG files in PHP, or used something like Fontawesome for icons, though I could also see using a some Javascript to include the SVG's dynamically in the browser for better browser support in this case.
